# Web Scraping 

This repository contains examples of web scraping scripts written in Python. The scripts demonstrate how to extract data from different websites using various Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Selenium.

## Installation

2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the scripts, navigate to the directory of the script and run it using the Python interpreter. For example, to run the `google_search_results.py` script:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `web-scrapping` directory: `cd web-scrapping`
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script: `cd Google-Search-Opener`
4. Run the script: `python google_search_results.py <search_terms>`

Replace `<search_terms>` with the search terms you want to search for. The script will open the top 5 search results in your default web browser.
